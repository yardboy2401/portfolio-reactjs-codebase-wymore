## Project Notes
React.js app deployed to GH-pages works well. All page redirects using useState and conditionals with onClicks works very well to avoid using React-Router due to issues with React-Router and GH-pages. I created separate repo's for the codebase and deployed app on GitHub. Links for both are above in the readme file.
